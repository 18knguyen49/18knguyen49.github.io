<h2>Ladder to Oblivion</h2>
<p>A young man finds a ladder appearing from the ground. He continues on to a treacherous journey through his past. With his magic and smarts, he must make the correct decisions in order to come out of this dunegeon alive.
<br><br> The process of creating the story was challenging and eventually frustrating once so many choices were amongst it. Many functions such as if or elif statements were necessary in the process. Raw input selection were also necessary for the readers to make choices.
<br><br>Not many problems arose throughout the process besides coming up with new ideas of getting confused with the abundant amount of choices. The best way to fix this was to just go back and go through the code slowly.
<br><br>I liked the work because of all the different scenarios the readers can take. If I could fix a part of it, it would be the fluidity of the story itself as it came out a litte choppy.
<br<br>One story I read was grueling and very detailed. I liked it because there were many choices to pick from with a different twist to each.
<br><br> If I had the chance to do this over again, I would make the story more connected, where every plot point leads to another without confusion.

<h3>Phillip's Fiery Depths of Hell</h3>
<p>The purpose of this game is to not allow Phillip's face to hit the icy cold brink by bouncing his face back and forth. Eventually, more faces appear and the player must try his/her best to prevent all faces from falling.
<br><br>The process of the scripts were difficult as some things didn't go the way we wanted it to go. We had to think beyond and about what would happen if this action was in place with other specific actions. 
<br><br>Difficulties were getting the face not to bounce against the floor and bar due to the horns. Although it wasn't solved, we hoped for the best XD.
